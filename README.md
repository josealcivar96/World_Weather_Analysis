# World Weather Analysis

The following project allowed us to assist the travel agency in determining desirable destinations for prospect travellers based on their weather preferences. We utilized the Google Maps API to search for hotels in over 760 cities and directions between four of those cities. 

## Results

The results and analysis are located in the ```weather_database```, ```vacation_search``` and ```vacation_itinerary``` folders, where we analysed the weather data of over 760 different cities, narrowed cities based on weather preferences and added directions between four cities as an itinerary for future travel.
